This is the backend for the mbt.guide projects. The code is based off of the backend portion of the [appy](https://appyapp.io/) app which heavliy utilizes the [rest-hapi](https://resthapi.com/) plugin for the [hapi](https://hapi.dev/) framework, which means MongoDB is used as a datastore. Please reference the docs for these tools for details.

## Configuration

- Copy .env-sample to .env and edit as needed. Don't commit .env to your repository.

## First time setup
**WARNING**: This will clear all data in the following MongoDB collections (in the db defined in ``restHapiConfig.mongo.URI``, default ``mongodb://localhost/appy``) if they exist: ``user``, ``role``, ``group``, ``permission``, ``session``, and ``authAttempt``.

If you would like to seed your database with some data, run:

```
$ npm run seed
```

NOTE: The password for all seed users is ``root``.

## Running the backend

```
$ npm start
```


Once the app is running point your browser to http://localhost:8080/ to view the Swagger docs.

## Testing

Currently the majority of the backend tests are e2e tests that rely heavily on scripts and docker
compose. These can be found in `test/e2e`. 

To run these tests run (from the root directory):
```bash
bash run_e2e.tests.sh
```
